This project was to take in the user input of hours, minutes, and seconds. Then it outputs a display of the clock in 12 and 24 hour formats. 
Having the clock update on its own would make this way better and cooler. 
What I feel I did well was code organization and readability. 
What I could enhance would be making the clock run the time instead of having to manually increase and decrease the time. 
The hardest part for me what making sure I covered all user inputs to make sure it was all valid. 
By adding comments and keeping things neat I believe I was able to make the code easily maintainable and adaptable.
